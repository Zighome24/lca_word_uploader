            <h2>How do I use this?</h2>
            <p>
                On the left hand side, you should see a drop down menu. This menu represents all of the folders in the top level of the WORD. As you select each folder, more drop-down menus will be added to allow you to continue choosing deeper and deeper sub-folders if you would like. The file you select to add (which I will discuss in more detail later) will always be added to the deepest folder you choose.
            </p>
            <p>
                If for some reason you need to add a folder to the drive, you can do that by choosing the "New Folder" option instead of a different sub-folder. This option allows you to add a folder. You can also add multiple levels of folders in a directory structure (aka 'level1/level2/level3/level4'). For example, if you want to add a new class to the CS major with a specific teacher and semester, you would select the "CS" major from the initial dropdown menu, and then you would select "New Folder". In the text box, you would put the directory structure just like a normal computer, aka '3556/Professor Sweat/Fall 2018'. This would add a new class folder 3556 under the CS major folder. Inside the 3556 folder it would add a new folder for 'Professor Sweat' with a final folder for 'Fall 2018'. Your file would then be uploaded under the 'Fall 2018' folder. So at the end, your file would now sit at 'LCA Word/CS/3556/Professor Sweat/Fall 2018'.
            </p>
            <p>
                On the right hand side, you can see a simple file selector. Simply use the 'Browse' button to select the file(s) you want to upload. You can upload multiple files at the same time, but for each upload all the files you choose will be uploaded to the same location. If you want to clear the file selector simply press the 'Clear Files' button.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finally, once you have choosen your folder location and your files just click the 'Submit' button and you should receive an alert once the files are uploaded.
